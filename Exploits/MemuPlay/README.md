The application needs to be installed and run by an Administrator account, then the exploit can be done through a low-priviledge account.

## Exploit

The *kali_script.sh* bash script should be run first on the machine running Kali Linux, it generates the payload, runs the server and the listener. Since it changes the var/www/html/ folder's permission, the root password could be asked. Then on the target machine running windows the *win_malicious.bat* should be executed, possibly from a low-privileged account. The script is automatic, it needs the attacker machine to run and keeps asking for user input/feedback. It downloads the payload from the attacker's server and substitutes the running *MemuService.exe* with the payload, at the end restarts or shutdowns the system to trigger the payload execution.
