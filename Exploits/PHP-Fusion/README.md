# PHP-Fusion CMS

## Installation

In order to install the vulnerable software, the download can be found at [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-fusion/files/PHP-Fusion%20Archives/9.x/PHP-Fusion%209.03.50.zip/download).
There is no installer for this application, the zip file should be extracted on the server's folder, in our test environment with XAMPP is *\xampp\htdocs*. 
Then the installation process should be done following the vendor's documentation at [this link](https://www.php-fusion.co.uk/infusions/wiki/index.php?cat_id=225).

### Issues

- The *Forum Infusion* should be activated during the installation process;
- Opening a new Forum could be tricky, to do that you should enter in the admin panel and add a new custom forum. Open several of them just to be sure, it is a bit buggy. 

## Exploit

There is not an automated exploit since it would consist in just a single curl POST request, we thought it would be easier to add the comment manually. In our test our input string was 

```html
<img onerror="alert('Malicious code')" src="" />
```
