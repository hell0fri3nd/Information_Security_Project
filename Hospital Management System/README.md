### Issue
There was a problem in our installation regarding the database login: in order to resolve this problem, the hospital/hms/include/config.php file should be modified.

The exploit is automated: the bash script should be downloaded on the same machine where the server has been launched. The execution of the request can be customized by changing the content of the alert function.
