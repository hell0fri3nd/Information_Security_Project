# Information Security

## Information Securty Course - Project (2019/2020) 

### Realized by automatizing known exploits.

This collection of exploits found on Exploit-DB and SecLists.Org, were tested by Andrea Righi
and Cristiano Lucian as project for the Information Security Course at Unibz. The majority of
the scripts for the automation of the exploits found in this project were developed by us.
